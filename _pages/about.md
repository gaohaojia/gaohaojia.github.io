Hello! My name is Haojia Gao and I come from Beijing, China. I'm currently an undergraduate student at the [Fan Gongxiu Honors College](https://fgx-hc.bjut.edu.cn/) of [Beijing University of Technology](https://english.bjut.edu.cn/), majoring in Artificial Intelligence, with an expected graduation in 2026.

I'm fortunate to have been admitted to the [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/), [Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School](https://www.sigs.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) for postgraduate studies, where I'll pursue a master's degree in Artificial Intelligence starting September 2026. My research interests focus on Robotics and Embodied Intelligence.

Feel free to reach out and connect with meâ€”I'm always open to interesting discussions and collaborations!
