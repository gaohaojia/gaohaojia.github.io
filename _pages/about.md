My name is Haojia Gao and I come from Beijing, China. I'm a student majoring in AI at [Fan Gongxiu Honors College](https://fgx-hc.bjut.edu.cn/), [Beijing University of Technology](https://www.bjut.edu.cn/). In the 2024 season and 2025 season, I led our school to participate in the [RoboMaster University Championship](https://www.robomaster.com/) as the captain and won several national awards. I'm currently learning neural networks, computer vision, SLAM, and path planning. Welcome to discuss with me.
